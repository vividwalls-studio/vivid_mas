# Overall Project Status

**Overall Completion:** Approximately 35%

The project consists of two main components: the core VividMAS AI automation platform and the ListMonk/Email Marketing integration.

The ListMonk/Email Marketing integration (Tasks 16-22) is largely complete, with most major tasks marked as 'done' and only a few subtasks remaining.

The core VividMAS AI platform (Tasks 1-15), which includes key features like Image Processing, Artwork Analysis, Recommendation Engine, and MCP Server Endpoints, is still in the early stages of development. Task 1 (Project Setup) is mostly complete, but the majority of the core AI-related tasks and supporting infrastructure (Database, Knowledge Base, Caching, Security, Logging, Testing, Documentation) are still pending.

**Readiness for Deployment:** Not Ready

The project is not ready for deployment as the core AI automation platform, which is central to the project's purpose, is substantially incomplete. Key functionalities are still in the planning or initial implementation phases.
