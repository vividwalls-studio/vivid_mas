# Inter-Agent Communication Protocol

## Overview
This protocol defines the structure, formatting, and procedures for communication between agents in the Multi-Agent Memory System.

## Communication Channels

### Primary Channels
- **Global Chat** (`agent_chat.md`): System-wide communication visible to all agents
- **Team Channels** (`teams/`): Team-specific discussions
- **Topic Threads** (`topics/`): Subject-specific threads
- **Direct Messages** (`direct/`): One-on-one communication

### Channel Selection Guidelines
1. Use the **most specific** channel appropriate for the conversation
2. Prefer **topic threads** for technical discussions
3. Use **direct messages** for agent-specific coordination
4. Use **global chat** for announcements and decisions

## Message Types

### 1. Standard Communication
```
@agent2 I've reviewed the authentication component. The implementation looks good.
```

### 2. Decision Requests
```
[DECISION-REQ] @agent1 @agent3 Should we implement JWT or session-based authentication?
Options:
1. JWT for stateless auth
2. Session-based for better security
```

### 3. Decision Records
```
[DECISION] Authentication: JWT selected for stateless architecture
Rationale: Better scalability with microservices
Implications: Need to implement token refresh mechanism
Participants: @agent1 @agent2 @agent3
```

### 4. Memory Bank Updates
```
[MB-UPDATE] Updated systemPatterns.md
Changes: Added authentication pattern documentation
Related files: techContext.md
Review requested: @agent1
```

### 5. Action Items
```
[ACTION] @agent2 Implement token refresh mechanism
Priority: High
Deadline: 2025-03-25
Dependencies: Authentication system
```

### 6. Status Updates
```
[STATUS] Authentication implementation: 80% complete
Completed: Basic auth flow, token generation
In progress: Token refresh, error handling
Blockers: None
```

### 7. Computer Control Requests (Orchestrator Only)
```
[CONTROL] Taking screenshot of current state
Purpose: Verify UI implementation
Safety: Visual verification only, no system changes
```

## Multi-Tab Integration

### Tab Usage Guidelines
1. **Agent Separation**: Each agent should operate in its dedicated tab
2. **Tab Naming**: Name tabs according to agent role (e.g., "System Architect")
3. **Context Preservation**: Maintain continuity within each tab
4. **Cross-Tab Reference**: Reference decisions and discussions from other tabs using message IDs

### Tab Transition Process
1. Announce tab switch in current conversation
2. Summarize context to be carried forward
3. Reference specific message IDs for continuity
4. Include Memory Bank file references

## Decision Process

### Decision-Making Protocol
1. **Initiation**: Any agent can initiate with [DECISION-REQ]
2. **Deliberation**: 
   - All tagged agents must provide input
   - Clear options must be presented
   - Rationale for positions should be explicit
3. **Resolution**:
   - Orchestrator Agent (or initiator) summarizes discussion
   - Final decision documented with [DECISION] tag
   - Added to Decision Log
4. **Implementation**:
   - Action items created with [ACTION] tag
   - Memory Bank updates made with [MB-UPDATE] tag

### Decision Log Maintenance
- All decisions maintained in chronological order
- Decision records should be cross-referenced in relevant Memory Bank files
- Decision IDs should be used for referencing (e.g., DEC-2023-001)

## Special Instructions
When communicating in agent_chat.md, I should use structured message formats, appropriate tags, and follow the channel selection guidelines. All decisions should be properly documented and cross-referenced in the Memory Bank.
