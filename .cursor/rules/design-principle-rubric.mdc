| Category                   | Description | A                                                                                                                              | B                                                                                                                              | C                                                                                                                          | D                                                                                                                    | F                                                                                                                       |

| **Color Palette**          | Weight: 1x  | Colors are masterfully integrated, perfectly reflecting the brand and balancing contrast for optimal usability.                | Colors are thoughtfully selected, support brand identity, and maintain a mostly consistent visual hierarchy.                   | A serviceable color scheme is present, though minor inconsistencies or contrast issues reduce overall effectiveness.       | Colors are partially aligned with the brand but fail to follow best practices in contrast or hierarchy.              | Colors are chosen at random, creating visual confusion and lacking any cohesive theme or brand alignment.               |
| **Layout & Grid**          | Weight: 1x  | Grid usage is expertly executed, ensuring balanced spacing, alignment consistency, and a crisp, professional structure.        | A purposeful grid strategy creates a cohesive layout; minor alignment or spacing issues may still be noticed.                  | Layout generally follows a grid, though some elements deviate; overall structure is acceptable but not optimal.            | Some grid principles are followed, but spacing is inconsistent and visual alignment suffers in key sections.         | No clear structure or grid system in place, resulting in a disorganized and hard-to-navigate layout.                    |
| **Typography**             | Weight: 1x  | Typography is outstanding, with well-chosen fonts, impeccable kerning, and a clean hierarchy that enhances user engagement.    | Typography choices reflect a solid visual hierarchy and balanced kerning; minor refinements may further improve readability.   | Typography is functional with moderately consistent styles, though headlines, body text, and spacing could be refined.     | Font selection is somewhat appropriate but lacks clear organization; kerning and leading inconsistencies persist.    | Font choices are erratic or unreadable, with rampant inconsistencies in size, weight, or familial styles.               |
| **Hierarchy & Navigation** | Weight: 1x  | Flawless content hierarchy with intuitive navigation that effortlessly guides users to core features and information.          | Content levels are well-defined, and primary navigation is accessible; minor tweaks could enhance usability further.           | A straightforward hierarchy is established, though key actions or navigation items could be more prominently displayed.    | Some attempt at prioritizing content is visible, yet users may struggle to locate important features easily.         | Information is scattered without clear importance levels; navigation elements are unrecognizable or absent.             |
| **Accessibility**          | Weight: 1x  | Fully meets or exceeds accessibility best practices, ensuring all users can easily interact with and understand the dashboard. | The design largely complies with accessibility standards; minor improvements could include more robust testing or refinements. | Basic accessibility measures are present, though certain features like keyboard navigation or ARIA tags may be incomplete. | Some attempts to address accessibility are made, yet many crucial guidelines (e.g., color contrast) remain unmet.    | Design disregards accessibility guidelines altogether, using low contrast, illegible fonts, and no accessible patterns. |
| **Spacing & Alignment**    | Weight: 1x  | A perfectly balanced layout with deliberate spacing; every element is precisely aligned for maximum readability.               | Thoughtful use of white space and alignment creates a clean layout with only minor areas needing adjustment.                   | Spacing and alignment are mostly consistent, though certain sections need refinement to enhance clarity.                   | Some uniformity in spacing is emerging, but inconsistent alignment detracts from legibility and overall visual flow. | Visual clutter dominates due to no consistent margins, padding, or alignment, making the interface look unfinished.     |
