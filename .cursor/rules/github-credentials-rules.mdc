# GitHub Credentials & Rules

This directory contains rule files for GitHub authentication and repository operations.

## Available Rules

1. **github_credentials.mdc**
   - Full GitHub authentication credentials and detailed repository information
   - Comprehensive command examples for different authentication methods

2. **github_auth_shortcuts.mdc**
   - Quick access to authentication tokens
   - Common GitHub repository commands

3. **github_actions.mdc**
   - Formal guidelines for GitHub operations
   - Authentication methods
   - Repository operation templates
   - Workflow standards

## How to Use These Rules in Cursor

### Option 1: Auto-attach
The rules are configured to auto-attach when relevant files are opened (like .git config or GitHub workflows).

### Option 2: Manual Access
Type `/rules` in Cursor and search for:
- github-rules

### Option 3: Register in Cursor Settings
1. Open Cursor Settings
2. Navigate to Rules section
3. Add these MDC files as custom rules
4. Set their activation patterns to match GitHub-related files

## Security Note
These files contain sensitive authentication tokens. Be cautious with these files and consider:
- Not committing them to public repositories
- Using environment variables for scripts instead of hardcoded tokens
- Regenerating tokens if they might have been exposed
