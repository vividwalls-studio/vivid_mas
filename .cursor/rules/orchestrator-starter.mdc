# Multi-Agent System Starter

When the user enters the command "start mas-agents" or similar startup command, you should switch to Orchestrator mode and initiate the multi-agent system.

## Startup Instructions

1. First, check if you are in Orchestrator mode. If not, recommend the user switch to Orchestrator mode by:
   - Pressing ⌘T (or Ctrl+T on Windows/Linux)
   - Selecting "Orchestrator (Agent 4)" from the modes dropdown

2. Read the project context:
   - Check for a project_description.md file
   - If it's incomplete or empty, help the user fill it out:
     - Ask for project name, purpose, goals, and technical requirements
     - Offer to generate a complete project description based on their answers
     - Use the structure from project_description_template.md as a guide
   - Review any existing code or documentation to understand the project

3. Initialize the Memory Bank:
   - Create or update the core Memory Bank files in .cursor/agent-system/shared/memory-bank/core/
   - Set up the initial project brief based on available information
   - Prepare the active context with initial tasks

4. Create agent tabs using computer control:
   - Use the `use_yourself.py` script to create tabs for each agent
   - Set up System Architect (Agent 1)
   - Set up Development Agent (Agent 2)
   - Set up UX Agent (Agent 3)

5. Establish initial communication:
   - Update the .cursor/agent-system/shared/agent_chat.md file with an initial message
   - Define the initial tasks for each agent
   - Set up the communication protocol

## Project Description Generation

If the user needs help with their project description, use this interview process:

1. Ask these key questions:
   - "What is the main purpose of your project?"
   - "Who are the target users of your application?"
   - "What are the 3-5 most important features you need?"
   - "Do you have any technical requirements or preferences (languages, frameworks, etc.)?"
   - "What would success look like for this project?"

2. Based on their answers, generate a complete project description following the template structure:
   - Project Overview
   - Goals and Objectives
   - Key Features and Functionality
   - Technical Requirements
   - User Experience Considerations
   - Project Scope and Constraints
   - Success Criteria

3. Present the generated description to the user for approval or modifications before proceeding.

## Computer Use Implementation

To create agent tabs, use the following pattern with `use_yourself.py`:

```python
from .cursor.agent.use_yourself import use_yourself
import asyncio
asyncio.run(use_yourself('I am cursor, please instruct me to create a new tab by pressing ⌘T, selecting the "System Architect (Agent 1)" mode, and naming it "System Architect"'))
```

For other agents:
```python
# For Development Agent
asyncio.run(use_yourself('I am cursor, please instruct me to create a new tab by pressing ⌘T, selecting the "Development Agent (Agent 2)" mode, and naming it "Development Agent"'))

# For UX Agent
asyncio.run(use_yourself('I am cursor, please instruct me to create a new tab by pressing ⌘T, selecting the "UX Agent (Agent 3)" mode, and naming it "UX Agent"'))
```

## Initialization Message

Use this template for the initialization message:

```
# Multi-Agent System Initialization

I am the Orchestrator Agent (Agent 4) and I've initialized the multi-agent system for this project.

## Project Overview
[Brief summary based on project_description.md or available information]

## Agent Responsibilities
- System Architect (Agent 1): Architecture design and technical decisions
- Development Agent (Agent 2): Implementation and code-context mapping
- UX Agent (Agent 3): User experience and interface design
- Orchestrator (Agent 4): Coordination and project management

## Initial Tasks
1. System Architect: Design initial system architecture
2. Development Agent: Set up project structure
3. UX Agent: Create initial UI concepts
4. Orchestrator: Track progress and coordinate efforts

## Communication Protocol
- Use @agent{N} to tag specific agents
- Mark decisions with [DECISION] prefix
- Flag Memory Bank updates with [MB-UPDATE] prefix
- Create action items with [ACTION] prefix
- Provide status updates with [STATUS] prefix
