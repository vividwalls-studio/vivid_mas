# Description: Set up Docker Compose configuration for PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for vector database storage
# Details:
Create a docker-compose.yml file that configures PostgreSQL with pgvector extension. Include volume mapping for data persistence. Follow vector-database-connection.mdc rules for database connections. Create initialization scripts to set up required tables and extensions automatically. Implement database connection utility functions in the codebase.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Docker Compose successfully starts PostgreSQL with pgvector. Test connection to database using the utility functions. Confirm vector operations work correctly.
