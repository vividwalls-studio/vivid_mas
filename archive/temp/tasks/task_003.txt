# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Color Theory Knowledge Base
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Convert color-theory.md content into a vector database using PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
# Details:
Parse the color-theory.md file and extract key concepts, principles, and relationships. Generate embeddings for each entry using OpenAI's embedding API. Store these embeddings in the PostgreSQL database with pgvector. Create tables for color theory principles, relationships, and psychological effects. Implement semantic search functionality to query the knowledge base. Expose this as an MCP resource/tool for LLM access.

# Test Strategy:
Test semantic search with various color-related queries. Verify accuracy of returned results against original color-theory.md content. Ensure MCP resource correctly exposes the knowledge base.
