# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Image Processing Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a pipeline to process customer-uploaded room images using OpenAI GPT-4o Vision API
# Details:
Implement an image upload endpoint that accepts room/space images. Use OpenAI GPT-4o Vision API to analyze the image for object detection and spatial analysis. Develop logic to identify and remove humans and animals from analysis. Map furniture placement and relationships. Identify all wall surfaces and determine optimal wall for artwork placement. Extract comprehensive color palette from the space with hex color codes for each identified item. Format results as HTML/CSS grid.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various room images to verify correct object detection, wall identification, and color extraction. Validate hex color codes against manual inspection. Ensure humans and animals are properly excluded from analysis.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement OpenAI Vision API integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create module for OpenAI GPT-4o Vision API calls
### Details:
Create image_processing/vision_api.py with functions for image analysis, object detection, spatial analysis. Follow OpenAI image generation guide for proper API usage

## 2. Create color extraction module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement color palette extraction from room images
### Details:
Create image_processing/color_extractor.py using scikit-image and OpenCV for color clustering, dominant color extraction, and hex code generation
