# Description: Develop a system to batch process VividWalls artwork catalog using OpenAI Vision API
# Details:
Create a batch processing system for the VividWalls artwork catalog (products_export.csv). Use OpenAI Vision API to extract color composition from each artwork. Analyze and store mood and tone attributes. Determine psychological impact of colors used and map emotional response indicators. Design and implement database tables to store artwork analysis results, linking color combinations to psychological effects, color attributes to emotional responses, and mood/tone classifications.

# Test Strategy:
Process a sample of artworks and verify color extraction accuracy. Validate psychological impact mapping against color theory knowledge base. Ensure all required attributes are correctly stored in the database.
