# Title: Implement Caching System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop caching mechanism for artwork analysis results to improve performance
# Details:
Design and implement a caching system for artwork analysis results to avoid redundant processing. Use database or in-memory caching depending on deployment requirements. Implement cache invalidation strategies for when artwork catalog is updated. Optimize vector search for sub-second response times.

# Test Strategy:
Measure performance with and without caching. Verify cached results match fresh analysis. Test cache invalidation to ensure updated data is properly reflected.
