# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Security Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Add security measures for API keys, input validation, and rate limiting
# Details:
Implement secure storage of API keys and credentials using environment variables. Add input validation for uploaded images (size, format, content). Develop rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse. Ensure proper error handling to avoid information leakage. Implement logging that captures security events without exposing sensitive information.

# Test Strategy:
Test with malformed inputs and verify proper validation. Attempt to exceed rate limits and confirm enforcement. Review logs to ensure sensitive information is not exposed.
