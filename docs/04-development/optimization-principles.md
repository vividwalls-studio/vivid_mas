# Optimization Upgrade Flow Plan

## Core Principles

### 1. Code Review Process
Before we generate any code, we must:
- Extensively think and review the optimization upgrade flow plan
- Ensure we're utilizing the code in the repository effectively
- Review attached files and documentation for context

### 2. Development Guidelines
- Review the code thoroughly before implementation
- Identify and call out any areas that still need optimization
- Work systematically through each optimization point until satisfied

### 3. Key Areas to Review
- Performance bottlenecks
- Code reusability
- Architecture patterns
- Resource utilization
- Error handling
- Security considerations
- Scalability factors

### 4. Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Review existing codebase structure
- [ ] Identify optimization opportunities
- [ ] Plan incremental improvements
- [ ] Test each optimization
- [ ] Document changes
- [ ] Verify no regression

### 5. Quality Gates
- All code must pass existing tests
- New optimizations should include tests
- Performance improvements must be measurable
- Changes should maintain backward compatibility
