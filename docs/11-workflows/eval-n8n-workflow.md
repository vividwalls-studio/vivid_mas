You are tasked with analyzing the existing n8n workflow JSON file provided and creating similar workflows for each identified agent. Follow these instructions carefully:

First, review this existing workflow JSON attached to understand the structure and format:

1. Now, analyze the following two n8n workflow JSON examples attached:

2. Carefully examine the workflow to identify all agents related to the main Agent and their relationships within the workflow.

3. For each identified agent: a. Determine its role and responsibilities b. Identify its relationships with other agents c. Note any specific tasks or actions it performs

4. Create a new n8n workflow JSON for each identified agent, following the structure and format of the example workflow. Ensure that each new workflow: a. Reflects the agent's specific role and responsibilities b. Includes appropriate nodes and connections c. Maintains relationships with other agents as identified in the original workflow

5. Use the n8n MCP tools to create these new workflows.

6. For each new workflow, provide annotation notes explaining the agent's role, responsibilities, and relationships with other agents. Format these notes similarly to the examples provided within the json code. The annotations should include the conditions that trigger the workflow, the expected output, and any relevant details about the agent's role within the workflow.

7. Think carefully and use first principles to ensure the information you provide is correct and will lead to the most optimal response.

8. Your final output should include: a. A list of identified agents b. For each agent:
   * The new workflow JSON (with embedded annotation notes)
   * Annotation notes for each n8n node within a workflow should align with the objective of the agent in the context of the Marketing Departments goals and objectives c. Any additional insights or observations about the overall agent structure and relationships

9. Format your output exactly like the three examples provided,
 including relevant annotation notes.

10. To ensure you provide the same level of detailed like the workflow examples. Output each agent one at a time. ensure you spend sufficient amount of time reviewing and analyzing the examples workflows provided attached against your proposed workflow. when you finish one I will review it iterate on it with you until the agent n8n code represents all the details like illustrated in the example workflows Paste text 2 and 3. Remember, your task is to analyze the given workflow, identify agents, and create new workflows for each agent using the n8n MCP tools. Your final output should only contain the list of agents, their respective workflow JSONs, with detailed annotation notes about the expected workflow triggers conditions and expected output, structured similarly to the provided n8n workflow examples.
